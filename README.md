üí° Key Features:

Visualized data for over 38K accounts and 25M in GL transactions
Interactive filtering options for better data drill-down and exploration
Comprehensive breakdown by region, sub-account, and activity type
This was a great opportunity to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions and improve financial strategy. Looking forward to further expanding my data visualization and financial analysis expertise!
